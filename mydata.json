(Selden's Preface to Drayton's Polyolbion.) But the epithet was also applied to the 47th proposition of Euclid, in which the squares of the two sides of the right-angled triangle stand out something like two horns. This proposition was confounded by Chaucer with the 5th proposition, the famous pons asinorum. This, for some reason, was in the middle ages termed Elefuga, which is explained as meaning ‘flight of the miserable,’ or, as Chaucer renders it. ‘flemyng of wreches.’ Ele was supposed to be derived from elegi, meaning miserable, and this latter was itself derived from elegia, meaning sorrow.

Friend is the most general word for persons who, through community of life or otherwise, have kindly feelings toward each other. Companion, literally a messmate, applies where the persons are much thrown together, but are not united by any strong tie; hence it is not a good synonym for husband or wife. “Many men may be admitted as companions who would not be altogether fit as associates,” Crabb, Eng. Synonymes, p. 197. Comrade denotes a close companion; it implies freedom of intercourse and a good degree of friendship: as, comrades in arms. Fellow has nearly lost its early signification of agreeable companionship, the later meanings having overshadowed it: as, “a bettre felawe schulde men noght fynde,” Compare fellow-feeling, fellow-helper, fellowship. Fellow in this connection may mean one who naturally would be or is a companion: as, why do you not go with your fellows? A partner is one who takes part with others, especially in business or in any kind of joint ownership. Formerly ally was nearly equivalent in meaning to associate, but it is now applied chiefly to states or rulers in their public capacity: as, the allies in the Crimean war. A colleague is an associate for some specific purpose or in some office; it is, like coadjutor, properly applicable only to one engaged in labor or business regarded as especially dignified: as, Senators A and B were colleagues; Luther and his coadjutors.

An apparition is a ghost as appearing to sight, perhaps suddenly or unexpectedly; it may also be a fancied appearance, while a ghost is supposed to be real: as, Jupiter made a cloud into an apparition of Juno; Macbeth saw an apparition of a dagger; the witches showed him an apparition of a crowned child. A specter is an alarming or horrifying preternatural personal appearance, having less individuality, perhaps, than a ghost or shade, but more than an apparition necessarily has. A phantom has an apparent, not a real, existence; it differs from a phantasm in emphasizing the unreality simply and in representing a single object, while phantasm emphasizes the deception put upon the mind, and may include more than one object.\",\"tags\":[\"wordnik\"],\"syns\":[\"ghost\",\"haunted\"],\"gender\":\"male\",\"id\":3062}",

The goldsmiths of the Middle Ages and Renaissance in Europe used engraving in the decoration of their work, and were accustomed to take impressions from their designs. Such impressions have been traced to the twelfth century. Among the earliest examples of engraving, properly so called, on metal are about three hundred prints in the dotted style (manière criblée) in which black spots are relieved against white and white spots against black, which date from about 1450 a. d. The practice of engraving was encouraged by the use of niello in the decoration of metals. (See niello.) Undoubtedly frequent impressions were taken from niello designs. For making plates to print upon paper, copper and later steel were substituted for other metals. Engraving on copper was extensively practised by the great artists of the Renaissance, as Pollajuolo, Mantegna, Botticelli, and Marcantonio Raimondi in Italy, and Martin Schongauer and Albert Dürer in Germany. In France engraving on copper found its first development in the illustration of books, as in the architectural series of Jacques I. Androuet Du Cerceau. In the seventeenth century the largest development of engraving on metal, occurred about the powerful personalities of Rembrandt and Rubens. The influence of Rubens, especially, brought about the culmination of the art. After this period, engraving on copper and steel became universal throughout modern civilization. The special contribution of England to the art of engraving on metal was the development of mezzotint, which was, however, invented in Holland in the middle of the seventeenth century. Wood-engraving was brought to perfection by the large school of German artists of the Renaissance grouped about the court of the Emperor Maximilian I. The chief of them was Albert-Dürer who may still be considered the greatest master of the art. From Germany the art of wood-engraving was carried into Italy, and practised with a peculiar charm by the painters of the quattrocento and cinquecento. The father of the modern art of wood-engraving is Thomas Bewick of Newcastle, England (1753–1828). Previous to his time the practice was chiefly in black line, that is, a drawing in black lines was made upon the block and the portions of the surface not touched by the draftsman were cut away by the engraver. Bewick established the ascendancy of the white line, that is, the incision made by the engravers' tools. This change in point of view vastly increased the effectiveness and artistic interest of the engraved block. The principles of Bewick have been accepted by all modern engravers whose interest is artistic rather than commercial. As in the case of engraving on copper and steel, the development of wood-engraving in modern times has been great, but little has been added to the fundamental principles established by the older masters.\",\"tags\":[\"wordnik\"],\"syns\":[],\"gender\":\"male\",\"id\":3415}",
